When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you are collaborating with others on the same project or to keep a copy of your files online for security and to be accessible from different workstations you use!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I don't want all commit versions to be updated if I am still working on a file, sometimes only the last version of the file has to be updated!

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks clone a repository directly between two GitHub accounts and then you can start making changes.
Clone copies a repository from remote to working directory.
Branches are inside a repository to difference the various phases of working on a project p.ex. if you are also collaborating everyone can create his own branch which can be merged later.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can continue working offline on your file and merge it later to the remote version.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier and what would be harder?
You have to be very clear in what everyone changes to not make the same or contrary changes. Git and GitHub make it easier to collaborate because they help finding easily the changes commited.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
If collaborating and wanting someone to check out first your changes it is useful to create a different branch. Making a separate branch is more secure but even needs some commands more to be merged later to the original.
