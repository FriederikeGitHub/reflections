When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you are collaborating with others on the same project or to keep a copy of your files online for security and to be accessible from different workstations you use!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I don't want all commit versions to be updated if I am still working on a file, sometimes only the last version of the file has to be updated!
