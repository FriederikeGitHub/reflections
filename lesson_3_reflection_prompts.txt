When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you are collaborating with others on the same project or to keep a copy of your files online for security and to be accessible from different workstations you use!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I don't want all commit versions to be updated if I am still working on a file, sometimes only the last version of the file has to be updated!

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks clone a repository directly between two GitHub accounts and then you can start making changes.
Clone copies a repository from remote to working directory.
Branches are inside a repository to difference the various phases of working on a project p.ex. if you are also collaborating everyone can create his own branch which can be merged later.
